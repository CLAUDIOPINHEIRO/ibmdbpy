Upload to Pypi:
1. Download from Github
2. in ibmdbpy-master:
python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel
twine upload dist/ibmdbpy-VERSION*

To make the doc:
cd docs
make html

Good practice -> test on testpypi before release:
python setup.py register -r pypitest
python setup.py sdist upload -r pypitest

Note that you should have the ~/.pypirc correctly set
